Freeze Land Lineage Overview
============================

Lineage Tree:
-------------
Freeze Land
├── M39 (Montreal 39)
│   ├── Skunk #1
│   └── Northern Lights #5
└── Friesland (aka Freezeland, Fry's Land)
    ├── Afghani
    └── Skunk #1

Combined Genetics Summary:
--------------------------
Freeze Land ≈ [(Skunk #1 × Northern Lights #5) × (Afghani × Skunk #1)]

Traits:
-------
- Cold resistance (from Friesland)
- Early flowering (from both parents)
- Heavy yield (from M39)
- Earthy, piney aroma with mint/citrus notes
- Deep body relaxation with cerebral calm

Revival Protocol – Phase 1:
---------------------------
1. Acquire:
   - M39 clone (Montreal)
   - Friesland or Freezeland seeds or clone (may require forum tracking or legacy sources)
   - Skunk #1 seeds
   - Afghani landrace
   - Northern Lights #5 seeds

2. Stepwise Breeding Plan:
   a. Reconstruct M39 if needed: Cross Skunk #1 × Northern Lights #5
   b. Reconstruct Friesland: Cross Afghani × Skunk #1
   c. Cross (Rebuilt M39) × (Rebuilt Friesland)
   d. Stabilize through phenotype selection (3–5 generations)

3. Archive all traits:
   - Growth notes
   - Visual indicators (leaf shape, trichome density)
   - Yield metrics
   - Aroma/flavor profiles
   - Lab test results (if possible)

4. Optional:
   - Introduce Freeze Land back into original soil/homeland to complete energy cycle
